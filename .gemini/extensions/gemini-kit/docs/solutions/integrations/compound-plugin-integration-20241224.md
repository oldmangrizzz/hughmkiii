# Integrating Antigravity Compound Engineering Plugin into Gemini-Kit

## Problem Statement

**Problem:**
Gemini-Kit has a powerful multi-agent system but lacks a **compound learning** mechanism - each session starts from scratch, with no persistent knowledge base.

**Impact:**
- Agents don't remember found solutions
- Work already done is repeated
- No health monitoring for compound behaviors

## Solution Overview

Integrate **Antigravity Compound Engineering Plugin** to add:
- Knowledge Base system
- 32+ workflows
- 50+ automation scripts
- Health monitoring

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Clone Compound Plugin

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salavender/antigravity-compound-engineering-plugin.git .compound-plugin-temp
```

### Step 2: Copy Core Components

```bash
# Copy scripts, skills, todos, plans
cp -r .compound-plugin-temp/{docs,scripts,skills,todos,plans} .

# Copy workflows (do not overwrite existing)
cp -n .compound-plugin-temp/.agent/workflows/* .agent/workflows/

# Set permissions
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Step 3: Create Missing Directories

```bash
mkdir -p docs/specs/templates docs/architecture docs/explorations
```

### Step 4: Create Architecture Documentation

Create files:
- `docs/specs/README.md` - Specs system guide
- `docs/specs/templates/spec-template.md` - Template
- `docs/architecture/README.md` - Architecture entry point
- `docs/architecture/compound-system.md` - Full architecture doc

### Step 5: Update GEMINI.md

Add **Compound Behaviors** section with:
- Session Resume protocol
- Search Before Solving
- Document After Solving
- Critical Patterns reference
- Health Check reminder
- Important Directories

### Step 6: Verify Integration

```bash
./scripts/compound-dashboard.sh
./scripts/validate-compound.sh
```

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/specs/README.md` | Specs system guide |
| `docs/specs/templates/spec-template.md` | Template for multi-session specs |
| `docs/architecture/README.md` | Entry point for architecture docs |
| `docs/architecture/compound-system.md` | Full compound architecture |
| `docs/explorations/compound-plugin-integration-20241224.md` | Exploration document |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `GEMINI.md` | Add Compound Behaviors section |

## Verification

```bash
# Health check
./scripts/compound-dashboard.sh

# Expected output:
# 🏥 COMPOUND SYSTEM HEALTH: D (New)
# Solutions: 2
# Patterns: 23 ✓
# Workflows: 32 ✓
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Cherry-pick, don't copy everything**: Gemini-Kit already has many features (agents, security), only add what is missing.

2. **Merge GEMINI.md carefully**: Keep the agent system intact, add compound behaviors.

3. **Verify after integration**: Run `validate-compound.sh` to ensure patterns are valid.

## Prevention Strategies

### When integrating new plugins

- [ ] Explore first with `/explore` 
- [ ] Compare features to avoid duplication
- [ ] Review after integration with `/review`
- [ ] Document with `/compound`
